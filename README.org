#+TITLE: Akka cassandra persistence playground
* Notes
Docker and docker-compose are used to manage the playground.

Start cassandra cluster (one seed and a node) in a terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

Start sbt console in another:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
docker-compose run --rm sbt sbt
#+END_SRC

See src/main/scala/service.scala and start sbt's run task in sbt's console.
